# Digital-Footprint-Detection-Browser-Extension
The Digital Footprint Detection Browser Extension is an advanced cybersecurity tool designed to enhance user privacy and awareness. Traditional solutions were fragmented, requiring multiple plugins to monitor cookies, trackers, and fingerprints, while providing only raw data with limited usability.
This project filled those gaps by creating a unified, real-time monitoring system that detects cookies, ad trackers, device fingerprints, and SSL/TLS certificate vulnerabilities while assigning a dynamic risk score to each browsing session. An interactive dashboard visualizes tracking activity, session history, and security insights in a clear, user-friendly manner. Added features like dark mode, data export (CSV/Excel), and certificate validation made the tool both practical and customizable. Beyond end-user awareness, the project supports cybersecurity professionals for auditing and forensic analysis. By bridging the gap between technical security concepts and everyday usability, the extension empowers users to better understand, evaluate, and control their digital footprint.
